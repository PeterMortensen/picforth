Problem:
  The "1 < if ..." test gives bogus result, as will probably "-1 < if ...",
  because "incf" and "decf" don't set the carry bit.
Solution:
  An explicit carry test should be conducted in "<" if the minus instruction
  gave "incf" or "decf", or an explicit "movlw sublw" instruction should be
  used.
